    <p class="intro1">Whether teachers faced a sea of black Zoom boxes, juggled simultaneous instruction for at-home and in-person learners, or taught full classrooms while worrying about COVID-19 spread, last school year was unlike any before it. But challenges weren’t all that was in store. Amid the uncertainty, the stress and the struggles, many educators gained new insights on themselves, their students and their practice. Here, five teachers across the U.S. share the unplanned lessons they learned in 2020-21 and what they’ll take with them after the pandemic.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>For Coral Zayas, the best parts of distance learning were live lessons and seeing her students interact during the ‘Fun Friday’ game hours she hosted.</p>
        <p>Those experiences came late, though. Many districts, including the one where Zayas teaches, had a delay between closing schools and starting live instruction, as they worked to distribute computers and tablets to students.</p>
        <p>“I would hope that if we're in this situation again or as we prepare for potential other shutdowns or anything else that might occur in the next year, that (district leaders are) a lot more prepared than they were now,” Zayas said. “Because I don't think it's acceptable that we're one week from school (ending) and we still have kids who never received (devices).”</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Seeing the technology gap between her district and neighboring ones took a toll, including many sleepless nights, Zayas said.
        <p>Her educator network helped her get through the semester. When distance learning began, Zayas volunteered to facilitate a Teach Plus support group that met twice weekly to discuss instructional strategies and self-care.</p>
        <p>“That has been crucial for me, because a lot of times I feel that those who are not teachers do not really understand everything that we do on a daily basis. But teachers do,” she said.</p>

        <div class="row story-text">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Teaching in one of the hardest hit areas of the country made the impact of the pandemic all too real for José Vilson. “The whole first two months and change, we were hearing about 10 sirens a day,” he said. “It can really rack on the brain in a way.”</p>
            <p>Vilson lives in Harlem, just a few miles from his students in Washington Heights. He said that makes it easier to understand what they’re experiencing.</p>
            <p>“I have students whose parents have passed away, whose family members have passed away, whose families also many of them are essential workers. And that's a lot. It's a lot of things going on right now. So we're just trying to manage it day to day.”</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Vilson said the way his school administrators checked in on teacher and student mental health and adjusted plans made a big difference.“It's that human touch that really had been missing for me for a really long time. This year I finally was able to get it, and that was important.”</p>
            <p>Although nobody was prepared for emergency distance learning, Vilson said that after two months he’d developed a rhythm and felt comfortable with the sequence of what he was teaching.</p>
            <p>An unresolved issue, however, was what live instruction should look like. Educators, students and parents had different ideas, Vilson said. “So without that conversation, it becomes really hard to navigate what the expectation is for everybody.”</p>

        <blockquote>“I must have said, ‘I can't do this’ 1,000 times this school year … <span class="pink quotebold">But every time — every time! — I could do it.</span> I could keep going.”</blockquote>

        <div class="row story-text">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>For Lauren Merkley, the 2020-21 school year started with a sense of foreboding. Her school began with both in-person and asynchronous virtual options. That meant she had to build an online class while also preparing for socially distanced traditional instruction. At the same time, ambient anxiety about possible closures loomed large. The school went fully remote twice in the fall because of surging COVID-19 numbers.</p>
            <p>“First quarter was brutal,” Merkley said. In her virtual classes, there were dozens of students she never saw or heard from. “They were ghosts,” she said. And that meant  failing more students than ever before. It was all so much. “I must have said, ‘I can't do this’ 1,000 times this school year,” Merkley recalled. “But every morning my heart was beating, and I found that I could do it. Whatever ‘it’ was that day.”</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The seeming impossibility of so many tasks forced Merkley, who in 2020 was the Utah Teacher of the Year, to accept imperfection in her teaching. She told students that she was learning alongside them and asked for their feedback. Though uncertainty persisted, things did improve after the first quarter. And like flowers pushing through cracks in concrete, some wonderful moments blossomed, too.  Like when her students read Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” In FlipGrid video responses and comments, the high schoolers drew connections between King’s rhetoric and contemporary questions about police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement. The discussion had the highest engagement of any activity in Merkley’s virtual classes.</p>
            <p>While not every lesson sparked that kind of response, Merkley said that the pandemic and the politics of the past year catalyzed students to look beyond their usual rhythm of school or work or soccer practice. They made connections between their lives and larger systems. “It's a both/and,” Merkley said. “It was (a year that we survived). But there were also moments where my kids felt so alive, where they felt so relevant, where what we were doing felt like it mattered.”</p>
            <p>For some teachers, the pandemic has tipped the scale from a stressful job to an untenable one, prompting them to walk away. Merkley, however, said this year reaffirmed her place in the profession. The successes may have been fewer, but they were hard won. “You're in it to help kids and to have those moments of discovery,” she said. “So when they came this year, I think they were all the sweeter because of that juxtaposition.”</p>

          <blockquote class="wide">"I used to think I was a pretty tech savvy teacher, but remote learning has taught me to <span class="purple quotebold">tap more into my tech skills </span>and use them to be more intentional with my students."</blockquote>

          <div class="row story-text">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>Jennifer Dao’s mathematics teaching style has always been pretty open-ended. There’s a lesson plan and a learning goal, of course, but after presenting a problem, she follows her students’ lead. “Whatever the kids do, I use it throughout the lesson to summarize and to piece together their work,” she explained.</p>
              <p>Without students in the same room as her until February, Dao decided to implement a new structure this year. Along with some colleagues, she adopted a practice called learning contracts from Larry Geni, a retired science teacher. Using this model, Dao started each class with a slide containing information and links to everything that would be covered that day. The class spent the first 40 minutes on a warm-up and the main lesson. For the second half of class, students chose a task from three options — “mild,” "medium" or "spicy" — to work on independently or with small groups.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>A mild task might be watching a review video on a foundational skill or completing guided notes with teacher support. Medium typically meant practice exercises for the day’s topic. And spicy tasks were advanced challenges related to the standard. Dao said this structure helped her organize class more clearly, and it showed her that students benefit from visual and written instructions, in addition to the oral ones she gives in-person. “I used to think I was a pretty tech savvy teacher, but remote learning has taught me to tap more into my tech skills and use them to be more intentional with my students,” she said.</p>
              <p>Choosing between tasks also improved students’ metacognitive skills by requiring them to take stock of their understanding. Students were “brutally honest” about themselves in weekly self-evaluations and optional blog posts, Dao said. Since she couldn’t see students’ independent work on paper, reading their self-reflections encouraged her. “It made me feel like the work that I put in wasn't for nothing, because a lot of teachers felt that frustration on Zoom, seeing just squares on a page. … It gave me a better snapshot of the kids.”</p>

          <div class="row less-margin">
            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Juan Gonzalez Jr. did not use technology too much in his classes. Adapting in the midst of a pandemic created a steep learning curve, but he started out optimistic.</p>
            <p>But when his school opted to continue grading despite disparities in home environments and technology, Gonzalez’s emotional state took a dive.</p>
            <p>“For me, it felt like teaching in the classroom but if five of my kids had to listen from the hallway. People would tell me, ‘Well, you know, focus on the kids who are there, who do have access.’ But I couldn't just focus on them and not think about those who weren’t getting the same.”</p>
            <p>That stress extended beyond the bounds of a traditional school day. Gonzalez said if he could go back he would set a better schedule for himself instead of doing lesson plans late at night. He also said that could have given himself more grace.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>“There was this enormous amount of guilt that I kept holding on to. And I think if you speak to any teachers, they'll tell you the same. I don't know why we do that to ourselves. Because we want our students, no matter who they are, to be successful. We want to be a part of that. And so it was just so hard to not feel powerless in that sense. I think that guilt also held me back from doing my best with what I had.”</p>
            <p>As summer approached, Gonzalez looked forward to a break from screens. Typically he travels to professional development events during the summer, but those are all canceled.</p>
            <p>Since he’s looping with his current students, he will use the time to design lessons for fourth grade. “I will hopefully not have to be on the Zoom for a while and then just kind of slowly and ease myself back into prepping for the following year,” he said.</p>
